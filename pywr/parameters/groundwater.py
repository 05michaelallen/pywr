    """
    A flow Parameter that returns stream flow from an Aquifer based on the groundwater level.

    The approach is based on the lumped parameter model by Keating (1982). This Parameter calculates the
     perennial and winterbourne stream flow components based on the Storage node. It requires the Storage
     node to have a valid level Parameter.

    In contrast to the Keating paper a general coefficient is provided for calibration. The Keating approach
     utilised a coefficient of $B/L$ where "$B$ and $L$ are the dimensions of the aquifer block parallel
     and perpendicular to the stream."
